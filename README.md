## Author: Ana Alferez
## Rights: Coursera IBM
## Purpose : Assignment for DS Specialization
## Important: Just check the end functions (bottom) of the Python files because the beginning contains HTML data from the web, which includes stock details such as price (open, high, volume, etc.) for the AMAZON_STOCK_WEB_SCRAPPING_ANA_ALFEREZ and AMD_stock_extraction_ANA_ALFEREZ files. However, for the Stock Price Google Prediction file it's readable since the beginnig.
